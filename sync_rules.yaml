# PowerSync Sync Rules
# This file defines which data is synced to which users
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Conventions used below:
# 1) Date/timestamp columns → `CAST(unixepoch(col) * 1000 AS integer)`
#    PowerSync helper returns seconds; multiplying by 1000 converts to milliseconds,
#    and casting to integer ensures 64-bit integer ms for `{ mode: 'timestamp_ms' }` columns.
# 2) Monetary `numeric` columns → `CAST(... AS real)`
#    Postgres `numeric` maps to TEXT by default; we cast to REAL so amounts arrive
#    as 8-byte floats, aligning with SQLite `REAL` columns defined in the client.
# Keep comments minimal; adjust only when new date or numeric fields are added.
